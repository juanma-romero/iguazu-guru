We got wrist bands as keys which is really much nicer than a key card and you don’t lose it. We paid for half board, buffet breakfast and dinner.\n\nThe food is average. It isn’t top quality, but what saves it is the variety. For example, every night the chicken and meat dishes were dry, but the soup and salad offering gave you options of higher quality. The arroz con leche was delicious. Drinks are not included so if you only drink water o suggest bring your own.\n\nEven during low season the hotel is 80% families with small children. They even offer babysitting services so this must be a haven for parents. For a couple traveling though it wasn’t as quiet and relaxing as we would hope. The pools and buffet always had kids running around. The hallways too, so sleep with white noise on. We knew this is what the hotel goes for after reading other reviews so no complaints, that’s just how it is.\n\nI got one message during my stay and it was very mediocre. Therapist’s hands were dry and technique very average.\n\nOverall though, we had a good experience. The beds were very comfortable, the food abundant, and the pools very nice. The location is excellent as it’s super close to the Argentina border so going to Iguazú on that side is easy. There is a mall right in front of the hotel, very easy to walk to, for shopping and lunch.",

While not a luxury property, it provides solid, dependable accommodation with amenities that cater to both business and leisure travelers.\n\nLOCATION: Perfectly situated just a short drive from Iguazu National Park, the hotel offers easy access to the breathtaking waterfalls. It's conveniently located near local restaurants and has good connectivity to transportation options.\n\nDINE + DRINK:The on-site restaurant serves a decent breakfast buffet with a reasonable variety of Brazilian and international options. While not extraordinary, the food is satisfactory. The bar area provides a comfortable space for evening drinks, though don't expect gourmet cocktails or extensive wine selections. They also have an attached Craft Beer bar with a fine selection of beers!\n\nROOM: We stayed in Room  1703, so this review is based on that;  SIZE: Spacious enough for 2 adults and simple baggage; VIEW: Sweet view of the cityscape; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting us to sleep; BATHROOM: Good sized bathroom with a Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Decent quality toiletries\n\nFACILITIES: No Gym on site, didnt have a chance to check the pool\n\nSERVICE: Friendly staff that cared for all our needs with a smile and made us feel at home and well taken care of.\n\nHOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi that works well all over the property, and the speed is good! Small Smart TV dishing out a wide variety of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies, and entertainment pretty much in PORTUGUESE language!",
